# Final-Project

The project aims to explore and implement a Binarized Neural Network (BNN) based on the MobileNetV3 architecture. By applying binarization techniques to the model's weights and activations, the project seeks to achieve efficient deep learning inference while maintaining competitive accuracy, particularly for resource-constrained devices such as edge devices and embedded systems.
